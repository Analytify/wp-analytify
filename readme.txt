== Notes ==

Analytify is the best Google Analytics plugin for WordPress. We make Google Analytics look EASY. You know all about Google Analytics and love the data it provides, but wouldn’t it be nice if there is a tool to make managing all of that complex information simpler?

You’re in luck.

Google Analytics Was Never This Fun In WordPress before.


*Following is a list of Testimonials you must read them once.*


Testimonial # 1

**Great way to understand your audience**

I've been using the Pro version for quite a while. I really love how it gives me in-depth information about each individual post. That kind of info is hard to navigate to in Google Analytics even if you're relatively familiar with it already. I discovered all kinds of new things about how people land on my site and how they engage with it just by activating the plugin and looking at the information it provides in the Dashboard and on individual posts.

The author is also an official Google analytics Partner, which I think speaks volumes. Well done all around, highly recommended!


Testimonial # 2

**Best Google Analytics Plugin**

This is something that clients really love as they of course want to see traffic to their site. However many do not want to log into google analytics and work their way through its rather complicated reporting modules. This gives all the headline stuff and more. What's really neat is that it does it for every single page as well. So you can really see what's going on for a particular post. So a google search for X led to this page. It also has great realtime reporting for the paid version. I had one small issue and the developer responded and addressed it immediately. Very impressed. It's become a default plugin.


Testimonial # 3

**Excellent Integrations with Google Analytics**

Many of my clients don’t want to view analytics outside their dashboard. This plugin integrates GA beautifully within the WordPress admin panel. I suggest you give it a spin. The developers are also very nice and dedicated to the plugin, which goes a long way.


Testimonial # 4

**Outstanding support and product**

Besides thinking the plugin is wonderful, I am equally impressed with the support team. I had issues and they emailed back and forth to resolve my issues and even update the plugin for me. I highly recommend this plugin which has been very beneficial to my analytics, but just as important, I appreciate the support in resolving my issue in a very timely manner.


You may buy the premium version to support the development.
